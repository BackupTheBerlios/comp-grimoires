cpudyn controls the speed in Intel SpeedStep, Pentium 4 Mobile
and PowerPC machines with the cpufreq compiled in the kernel.
By using cpudyn you should not not notice any performance
impact, but nevertheless you should save battery consumption
and reduce the temperature of your laptop.

It can also set the spindown timeout on your hdd's
