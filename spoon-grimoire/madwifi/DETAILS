cat << EOF
A Linux device driver for 802.11a/b/g universal NIC cards -
either Cardbus, PCI, or miniPCI - that use Atheros chip sets
(ar5210, ar5211, ar5212). Documentation is slight at best,
but seems to function well on some systems, unstable on others.
Project is under steady development.
It's partly closed source.
